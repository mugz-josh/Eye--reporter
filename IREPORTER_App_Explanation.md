# IREPORTER App: A Simple Guide for Everyone

## What is IREPORTER?

Imagine you're walking down the street and you see a big pothole that could damage cars, or you notice some government workers acting suspiciously. What do you do? With IREPORTER, you can easily report these issues right from your phone or computer!

IREPORTER is like a digital "report card" for your community. It lets regular people like you tell the government about problems that need fixing, or warn them about corruption. It's designed to make it easy for citizens to speak up and hold authorities accountable.

## The Two Main Types of Reports

### 1. Red-Flag Reports 🚩
These are for serious problems like:
- Corruption (like a government official taking bribes)
- Crime or illegal activities
- Safety hazards that could hurt people

**Example:** You see a police officer asking for money to "speed up" a traffic ticket. That's corruption! You can report it as a red flag.

### 2. Intervention Reports 🔧
These are for things that need government help to fix:
- Broken roads or bridges
- Flooding problems
- Schools or hospitals that need repairs
- Any public service that's not working properly

**Example:** The street light near your house hasn't worked for months, making the area dangerous at night. That's something the government should fix!
